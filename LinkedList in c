How Linked lists are different from arrays? Consider the following points :

An array is a static data structure. This means the length of array cannot be altered at run time. While, a linked list is a dynamic data structure.
In an array, all the elements are kept at consecutive memory locations while in a linked list the elements (or nodes) may be kept at any location but still connected to each other.

When to prefer linked lists over arrays? Linked lists are preferred mostly when you donâ€™t know the volume of data to be stored
